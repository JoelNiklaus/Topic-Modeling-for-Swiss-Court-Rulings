When performing various analysis on Court Rulings the vast amount of available data makes the analysis rather complex and time consuming. Therefore the goal of the project was to perform topic modeling over a multilingual dataset of Swiss Court Rulings to group the Rulings into meaningful topics, so that analysis can be done on these groupings.

This repository contains the colab notebook to traing the topic models. Furthermore, it contains the resulting visualizations and evaluations.
